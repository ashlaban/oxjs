            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr class="section-divider">
            <p>Welcome to the world of pattern puzzler, where you will be tasked to recreate a specific pattern; However, there is a catch. You can only paint with a limited set of brushes. Can you figure out how to solve the puzzle and win the <em>ultimate</em> prize?
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <hr class="section-divider">
            <p>This is the super demo version. You have one brush available that applies the ternary logic operator <em>sum</em>. (This is basically like the binary <em>xor</em> operator but ternary logic is a little bit more weird than binary.)</p>
            <p>Anyways, there are three possible values, <em>cyan</em>, <em>brown</em> and <em>magenta</em> representing -1, 0 and 1 respectively. The current brush performs elementwise ternary addition without carry, meaning that you can toggle the state of the individual cells.</p>
            <p>The three levels presented are all clearable, but the last one can be really tedious and requires <em>advanced techniques</em>. The first level can be solved in 1 move, the second in 10 and the third requires many, many moves.</p>
            <h2>Advanced stuff</h2>
            <hr class="section-divider">
            <p>I will add something here at some point. Perhaps explaining some ternary logic.</p>
